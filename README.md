GameFAQs Collapsible Spoilers
======================================
Don't like the highlight/hover-to-reveal method of spoilers on GameFAQs? This script will convert spoilers to collapsible spoilers that can be clicked to expand/collapse said spoilers.

#### &darr; CAUTION &darr; ####
If you use the quick quote feature of GameFOX or GameWeasel, then any spoilers quoted while using this extension may automatically have the reveal/hide button included in the quote, so make sure that you remove those from said quote before posting if it gets picked up.

Use with one of the following browser extensions:

### Mozilla Firefox ###
*	[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
*	[Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/)

### Google Chrome ###
*	[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
